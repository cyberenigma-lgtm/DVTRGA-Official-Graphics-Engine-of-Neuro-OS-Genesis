# Legal Disclaimer & Liability Notice

## ⚠️ Important Safety & Legal Information

**DVTRGA** (Direct Visual Transport & Render Graphics Architecture) is a high-performance graphics engine designed for professional and experimental environments.

### 1. No Liability for Damages (Foundation of Clean Integrity)
The author, **José Manuel Moreno Cano**, provides **legitimate, clean, and verified code** developed under strict quality and safety standards. Because the software is delivered in a state of proven integrity, the author is **categorically excluded** from any liability for damages arising from its use.

Under no circumstances shall the author be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and under any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise), arising in any way from the use of this software.

### 2. Inherent Safety & Integrity
The official, unmodified **DVTRGA** driver is engineered with high safety standards and has been rigorously tested for stability on supported hardware. It is designed to operate within safe physical thresholds of the CPU, memory subsystem, and display hardware.

### 3. Unauthorized Modifications
**WARNING**: Any unauthorized modification, refactoring, reverse engineering, or tampering with the core logic of **DVTRGA** may result in:
- Critical system instability.
- Unpredictable hardware behavior.
- Potential damage to the display controller or memory bus.

The author assumes no responsibility for malfunctions, failures, or damages resulting from altered or unofficial builds. Use only official, signed versions of **DVTRGA**.

### 4. Experimental Nature
While stable, **DVTRGA** operates close to the physical limits of hardware synchronization and memory throughput. By using this software, the user acknowledges the inherent risks associated with high-performance graphics engines and experimental computing environments.
