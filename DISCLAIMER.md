# Legal Disclaimer & Liability Notice

## ⚠️ Important Safety & Legal Information

**DVTRGA** (Direct Visual Transport & Render Graphics Architecture) is a high-performance graphics engine designed for professional and experimental environments.

### 1. No Liability for Damages (Foundation of Clean Integrity)
The author, **José Manuel Moreno Cano**, provides **legitimate, clean, and verified code** that has been developed under strict quality standards. Because the software is delivered in a state of proven integrity, the author is **categorically excluded** from any liability for damages.

Under no circumstances shall the author be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software.

### 2. Inherent Safety & Integrity
The official, unmodified **DVTRGA** driver is designed with high safety standards and has been rigorously tested for stability on target hardware. It is built to operate within safe physical thresholds of the CPU and display hardware.

### 3. Unauthorized Modifications
**WARNING**: Any unauthorized modification, refactoring, reverse engineering, or tampering with the core logic of DVTRGA can lead to:
- Critical system instability.
- Unpredictable hardware behavior.
- Potential damage to the display controller or memory bus.

The author is **NOT** responsible for any malfunction or damage resulting from modified versions of the driver. Use only official, signed builds of DVTRGA.

### 4. Experimental Nature
While stable, DVTRGA by definition operates at the physical limits of hardware synchronization. By using this software, the user acknowledges the risks associated with high-performance graphics engines.
